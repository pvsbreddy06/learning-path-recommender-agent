# System Architecture

The Learning Path Recommender Agent follows a multi-agent architecture.

## Flow:
1. Learner submits profile and goals
2. Skill Assessor evaluates current skills
3. Gap Analyzer identifies missing skills
4. Path Optimizer generates learning sequence
5. ScaleDown Engine compresses content
6. Progress Tracker monitors performance
7. Peer Matcher suggests learning peers

This modular design ensures scalability and easy extension.
