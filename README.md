# learning-path-recommender-agent
AI-powered agent that creates personalized learning paths using skill gap analysis, ScaleDown optimization, and adaptive learning intelligence.
📘 Learning Path Recommender Agent

An AI-powered educational agent that creates personalized learning paths by analyzing learner skills, identifying gaps, and optimizing course content using ScaleDown techniques to improve learning efficiency.

🚀 Project Overview

Today’s learners face an overload of online courses with little guidance on what to learn, in what order, and how long it will take.
This project solves that problem by generating custom learning journeys based on:

Current skill level

Target role or goal

Available learning time

Course prerequisites

The system uses a multi-agent architecture to recommend the most efficient learning path.

🎯 Problem Statement

Learners struggle with:

Overwhelming course catalogs

Lack of personalized recommendations

Poor prerequisite awareness

Inefficient time utilization

Learning Path Recommender Agent addresses these issues by intelligently analyzing skill gaps and recommending optimized learning sequences.

🧠 System Architecture

The platform is built using multiple intelligent agents, each responsible for a specific task:

Agent	Description
Skill Assessor	Evaluates the learner’s current skills
Skill Gap Analyzer	Identifies missing or weak skills
Path Optimizer	Generates an optimized learning path
ScaleDown Engine	Compresses course content by 75%
Progress Tracker	Tracks learner progress and performance
Peer Matcher	Suggests peers with similar learning goals
✨ Key Features

✅ Personalized learning paths

✅ Skill gap analysis

✅ Prerequisite detection

✅ Difficulty adaptation

✅ Time and effort estimation

✅ Certification planning support

✅ Peer learning recommendations

📉 ScaleDown Optimization

To improve learning efficiency, the system applies ScaleDown techniques:

Removes redundant lessons

Prioritizes core concepts

Converts long courses into micro-modules

Retains only high-impact learning content
